# GPTquine

A LLM powered quine: Program that makes a request to ChatGPT to generate it's own source code and print it (probably not an actual quine without getting chatgpt to reveal it's source code :-).

## Requirements

- Requests
- ChatGPT api key in the file api_key.txt
  
```
pip install requests
```
